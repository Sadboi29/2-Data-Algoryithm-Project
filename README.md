## Description

Given list of bank locations, how much money each one holds and the time it would take to rob each one, you need to apply your hard-won algorithm knowledge to make as much profit as possible! _I bet you didn't think that data science could be this profitable!_

You will design and write a solution to an NP-Had algorithm to this problem

You will need to apply all the knowledge learned up to now to get the best possible result at this task given a large list of banks and 3 minutes to run your algorithm.

The list of banks is in `data/bank_data.csv`. This is what the data looks like.

```csv
id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate, money, time (hr)
0, 11.4, 3.3, 5000, 0.6
1, 6.9, 7.1, 15000, 0.3
2, 1.4, 13.2, 900, 1.1
```

You have **24 hours** to make as much money as possible and then escape.
